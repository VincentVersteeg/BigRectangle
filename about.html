        <h1>About Predictor</h1>
        <p>Work on Predictor started near the end of May 2012 by StereotypicalApps' main programmer Owen Versteeg. It is built with <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a>, <a href="http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome">Font Awesome</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, <a href="http://www.mysql.com/products/">MySQL</a>, and <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/">HTML5</a>.</p>

          <h2>How did Predictor get started?</h2>
           <p>StereotypicalApps' founder, Owen Versteeg, was falling asleep. Suddenly, a wild idea appeared. He wrestled to grab onto it as fast as he could, most likely breaking several appendages in the process. Once he had captured the idea, he wrestled with it for a few minutes, posing himself questions such as "Is this a feasible idea?", "How much of my random-Internet-browsing time will this take up?", and "Is it really 12PM <i>already</i>?</p>
		  <h2>Well, what happened next?</h2>
           <p>Owen woke up, coded like mad for 15 minutes, and went back to random-Internet-browsing. Hours later, he found some website that suggested the use MySQL and Javascript for a login system. He promptly got to work developing a login system. Once one was developed, he created the main page with Twitter's Bootstrap and liked it so much he decided to use Bootstrap for the entire site. He promptly created something pretty awesome in not much time with Bootstrap, managing to create these very readable welcome pages and ensure that they worked on all devices and browsers. Owen realized that the site didn't work in Opera but did work in Opera Next. &lt;sarcasm&gt;He instantly set to work developing a complex system to reposition menu items and buttons for Opera so that the three Opera users would see the site look pretty if they used Opera within a small time-frame of between now and the next Opera update.&lt;/sarcasm&gt;</p>
		  <h2>And what happened after that?</h2>
           <p>Owen started to spread the word about Predictor, and Predictor's userbase started to grow. More and more people started to use Predictor. However, Predictor wasn't ready for a launch just yet, so Owen had to prevent registration by making you enter a super-special key to use Predictor. People could obtain a key by using the button on the front page.</p>
